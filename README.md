## Hi there! 👋

👋 Yo! I'm **Y7X** — the definition of *built different* 😜  
Rooted Android since 2018, audiophile since age 6, lowkey a hacker (left), highkey underrated, and completely obsessed with customizing life one system at a time.

### 💥 WHO TF IS Y7X?

📱 **Android since Day 1** – I was rooting phones in 6th grade when most kids were still figuring out how to turn off their screen timeout. Stock UI? Never heard of her.  
💻 **Currently surviving on a Mac** – Not by choice, (-thanks dad). Android dev workflows? Yeah, I run that. Don’t test me.

🎧 **Music = my oxygen**  
- Max volume. When needed.  
- Bass boosted until my soul shakes.  
- Emotional songs when I’m in the feels.  
- **YT Music > Spotify** — and I’ll fight anyone who disagrees 🤡😜  
Music hypes me, heals me, motivates me, and gives me direction when nothing else can.

🎨 **Art & vibes enthusiast** — Haven’t built a UI from scratch, but trust me, I know the blueprint. It’s all about the feel, the aesthetic, and that smooth user flow.

🌶️ **Spicy food? My personality.** If it doesn’t burn, it doesn’t belong.  

🚗 **Cars > Bikes** forever.  

🎬 **Animation** runs my world — the detail, the expression, the escape. If it’s live-action, gimme high school drama with a twist or I’m out.

🧠 **Tech brain activated 24/7**  
- 1000s of AI tools bookmarked.  
- Scripts for everything.  
- Always solving problems before they’re even problems.

🇩🇪 **Learning German** just for the thrill of it. Why not flex a language too?

😷 **COVID Era Hacker Arc:**  
In 8th grade, I hacked 2–3 server-based games and earned massive underground clout.  
Not naming the games, but let’s just say… respect was earned. People knew. It was legendary.

🧒 **Lil cousin moment:**  
My lil cousin (like 5–6 years younger than me 😭) put me on to **Chilla's Art** and **Fears to Fathom** — yup, she’s got insane taste.  
And way back in his prime, my dad was out here introducing me to **Empire Earth** — the OG of OGs 💀

🎮 **Gamer with a dream** – currently vibing with NFS & Supercell titles, but longing to enter the world of AAA games.  
Mac holding me back (thanks dad), but that won’t last forever.

💭 **Shenzhen Dream:**  
One day, unlimited money in hand, I’m walking into Shenzhen like it’s my second home — buying parts, building rigs, living the tech life to the fullest.

### 🔥 THE ENERGY I BRING

I don't wait for the future — I make it.  
I break rules, reverse engineer them, and rebuild better.  
I don’t copy trends — I customize them.

I'm not just "into tech" — I *am* tech.  
And trust me, the world hasn’t seen anything yet.

## 📌 About Me

Hey there! I'm **Y7X**, a self-taught tech enthusiast with a deep love for all things customizable. I’ve been into Android since 2018 and have spent years exploring the limits of what devices, tools, and platforms can really do when you take full control.

Currently 17, I’ve already gone through:
- 🛠️ Rooting & modding Androids since middle school
- 💻 Rocking a Mac (by force 😭), still making it run like an Android dev machine
- 🎧 A lifelong passion for music, especially bass-heavy emotional tracks at full volume  
- 🎮 Casual gamer into NFS, Supercell, and wishing for AAA titles (Mac pain 😩)
- 🧠 Constant tech research — I’ve bookmarked 1000+ AI tools and actively stay updated
- 🇩🇪 Currently learning German just for the love of knowledge and challenge

Beyond tech:
- 🎨 I’m big on aesthetics and vibes. Haven’t built full UIs yet, but I know the flow, structure, and how to make something feel right.
- 🎬 Huge fan of animation — nothing hits quite like it. And for IRL? High school dramas with spicy twists hit different.
- 🌶️ I survive on spicy food and crave car culture (bikes? not for me).
- 🧒 Shoutout to my lil cousin who introduced me to Chilla’s Art and Fears to Fathom — absolute bangers.
- 🕹️ And my dad’s a real one — showed me Empire Earth in his prime. GOAT move.

Whether it's hacking (back in the 2020 era), learning new tech, tweaking workflows, or just vibing to music, I’m always exploring, building, and optimizing.

I'm not just here to code — I’m here to create, customize, and leave a mark.
